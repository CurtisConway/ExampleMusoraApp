# ExampleMusoraApp
A simple example app built using React Native and MusoraJS




## Getting Started

`npm install`

This app requires a React Native version higher than 0.60, and Node Version of 10.16. 

If you have the old react-native-cli installed globally it's recommended to uninstall it:

`npm uninstall -g react-native`

`npm uninstall -g react-native-cli`

npx comes shipped with Node and will handle everything else for you. If npx did not install automatically on your machine:

`npm install -g npx`

### IOS
`cd ios`

`pod install`

`npm start`

In a separate terminal:

`npx react-native run-ios`

### Android
`npm start`

In a separate terminal:

`npx react-native run-android`
